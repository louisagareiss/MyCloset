# About this Project

Last year's Swift Student Challenge I created a playground supporting students Mental Health. This year I created something in another field which needs more attention: fashion & environmental protection, carbon footprint and how to reflect on your fashion choices. It's called MyCloset. With MyCloset you can have your own closet but on your iPad. You can quickly see what clothes you own and what clothes you maybe don't wear often. You can take action by recycle, gift, resell or even up cycle your clothes to give them a second chance. By giving the clothes a second chance you protect the environment, reducing your own carbon footprint by saving water, transportation and other resources that are used to make a new Item. It's simple: Just tap on the Plus Icon, take a photo, fill out some details and you have added one item of many to come. For the minimal white-black UI, I designed custom Buttons, Textfields and Ratio Buttons entirely with SwiftUI. I used CoreData to save the Items on the device. I hope that this playground helps people to think about their fashion choices to protect our planet that we are all live on.
